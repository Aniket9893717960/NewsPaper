        <h2>BCCI Calls Meeting With Gautam Gambhir
            , Says Report. Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma May Be Given...</h2>
        <p>
            The future of leading batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will be discussed threadbare in a meeting that head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar is scheduled to hold with BCCI officials to review the recent tour to Australia on Saturday. The back-to-back series defeats against New Zealand (home) and Australia (away) and the diminishing returns with the bat have put Kohli and Rohit under scanner.

        <h2>How these Solar Didis played a key role in promoting a circular economy in agriculture</h2>
        <p>
            Devki Devi, a resident of Ratanpura village, Bochcha tehsil of Biharâ€™s Muzaffarpur district, was an ordinary housewife. Today, she provides solar-powered irrigation solutions to scores of farmers, on roughly 35 acres of land. Sunita Devi of Bhagwanpur Dadhya in Karanpur South Panchayat in the same tehsil, who was also earlier confined to the home, tending to her family and the cattle, also offers irrigation solutions to farmers, on 32 acres.

        <h2>NCP row: Sharad faction can use 'NCP-Sharadchandra Pawar' name till further orders, SC says</h2>
        <p>
            A transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a gradual process, particularly in developing nations and emerging economies. Entrepreneurial endeavours such as the Solar Didi could be the intervention a country such as India needs. It  addresses critical issues of climate change, rural income stagnation, enhanced farm income and productivity, and, perhaps, one of the most important issues, empowering women in rural India, believe experts.
